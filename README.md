# Skyrim Alchemist Field Guide

Welcome fellow potion brewers, both experienced and new! Are you in search of ingredients that turn you invisible, a brew that will make you strong as an ox, or a potion that will make your bow aim true? Then you're in luck! Save your back from carrying a million different books on alchemy with this handy dandy field guide!

Do you have some leftover blisterwort but don't know what to mix it with? Rather than waste your ingredients through trial and error (or worse yet, eating them ugh), simply click anywhere on its card and all its compatible friends will be right there for you to play with. 

But don't forget the search magic! Perhaps the greatest part of this guide the Archmage of the College of Winterhold toiled endlessly on. You can search for ingredients by name, or even one of its potion effects! How marvelous is that?! I myself on occasion or two may have forgotten how to make a Potion of Cure Disease...

That's enough lollygagging! Try it out for yourself.
